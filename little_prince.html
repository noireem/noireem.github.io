          As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
          <span class="text-underline"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
          <span class="text-highlight">It seemed to me, even, thaht there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>  
          In the moonlight, I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
          <span class="text-emphasis">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
          As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
          <span class="text-emphasis">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines
            through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <span class="text-underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
